# Electricity And Air Pollution

![Welcome image](https://github.com/medamer/Built-week-1/blob/master/Images/smokes.png)

My project is about the electricity production using diffrent sources. I splited the sources to two categories, clean and non clean. Clean sources are Hydroelectric Conventional, Nuclear, Pumped Storage, Solar, and Wind. The non clean sources are fossil fuels and materials that come from plants, municipal and industrial wastes.

The source of the datatset used is US Energy Information Administration www.eia.gov

## Steps:

* Imported 2 datasets, and cleaned them using Pandas
* Renamed the columns
* Merged them
* Replaced NaNs with zeros
* Built graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn
